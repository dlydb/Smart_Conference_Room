The project is to development a method for real-time person tracking and coarse pose estimation in a smart room. Using a sparse array of sigle pixel time-of-flight(ToF) sensors, the project not only saves budget on sensors and energy, but also preserve privacy of occupants compared to commercial video cameras. The tracking algorithm includes higher level logic about how people move and interact in a room and makes estimates about the locations of people even in the absence of direct measurements. A maximum likelihood classifier based on features extracted from the time series of ToF measurements is used for robust pose classification into sitting, standing and walking states. We use both computer simulation and real-world experiments to show that the algorithms are capable of robust person tracking and pose estimation.
